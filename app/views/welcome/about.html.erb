	<h1>About This Site</h1>
	<p>Old school pro wrestling! Heroes stand for honor and justice and all that is right; heels cheat and even though they are wrong, think they are right; and the most important things in the federation are titles and being recognized as the and the best at what you do. Superstar Pro Wrestling, plays like the wrestling you grew up with and takes you back to simpler time of kayfabe, raucous cheering, boos and making you believe that what you are rolling is real. </p>
	<p>This Website serves a small but passionate community playing either the dice-based or compuer version of a 1980s pro wrestling simulation game. It calculates the relative strenghts of each wrestling card and provides tools for users to make new ones that reflect the writer's desire for them to win or lose matches.</p>
	<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
	<p>You can always give me money.</p>
	<p>What would also help is if you were able to provide to me scans the original cards made in the 1980s. I'm specifically looking for scans of the entire Promoter's Dream, Deluxe and 1986 sets, with some gaps in the 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987 releases. In the wrestler index, if you see a card that says (not checked), or if it's not included at all, it means that I have not seen a physical copy of the card to make sure that the values are correct.</p>
	<h1>About The Superstar Pro Wrestling Board Game</h1>
	<p>In 1984, the Superstar Wrestling Game Co. began selling The Superstar Wrestling Game", promising "All the Action of Live Matches Right In Your Home!". Sets of wrestlers from 1983 through 1988 were made so that fans could create dream matches before copywright (and possibily other) issues prevented the company from continuing making more. Fans of the game keps playing however, and some have been generating cards for almost 40 years.</p>
	<p>The game plays simply, which is why players appreciate the design. Wrestlers roll on their general card first, to see if they are on offense or defense. If they are on offense, they roll on their offensive card, and hit a move with a pre-determined point value. If they are on defense, they have a chance to either absorb the blow, reverse it, or take the punishment with no defense. Wrestlers fight in rounds, with any pre-determined time limit until a victor is reached by pinfall, countout or disqualfiication</p>
	<p>The tagline of the game from then to now is accurate - All the action of live matches, right in your own home! See you in the ring.</p>
