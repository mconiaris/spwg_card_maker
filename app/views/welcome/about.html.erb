<h1>About This Site</h1>
<p>This Website serves a small but passionate community playing either the dice-based or compuer version of a 1980s pro wrestling simulation game. It calculates the relative strenghts of each wrestling card and provides tools for users to make new ones that reflect the writer's desire for them to win or lose matches.</p>
<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
<p>You can always give me money.</p>
<p>What would also help is if you were able to provide to me scans the original cards made in the 1980s. I'm specifically looking for scans of the entire Deluxe and 1986 sets, with some gaps in the 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987 sets. In the wrestler index, if you see a card that says (not checked), or if it's not included at all, it means that I have not seen a physical copy of the card to make sure that the values are correct.</p>
<h1>About The Superstar Pro Wrestling Board Game</h1>
<p>In 1984, the Superstar Wrestling Game Co. began selling The Superstar Wrestling Game", promising "All the Action of Live Matches Right In Your Home!". Sets of wrestlers from 1983 through 1988 were made so that fans could create dream matches before copywright (and possibily other) issues prevented the company from continuing making more. Fans of the game keps playing however, and some have been generating cards for almost 40 years.</p>
